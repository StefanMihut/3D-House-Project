  ## Mission Objectives  
  - to be able to search and implement new librairies  
  - to be able to read and use shapefiles  
  - to be able to read and use geoTIFFs  
  - to be able to render a 3D Plot
  - to be able to present a final product  
  ## About Project  
  This Project consists of building a 3D of a house/building based on a adress location  in the Flemish region of Belgium.  
  The data used is [Lidar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) data. This data is divied in 43 areas , each area is represented by an encoded raster geoTIFFs file(.tif) in two formats DSM and DTM  
    
  ## Run Project 
  Requirements  
  ### librairies  
  - geopandas  
  - rasterio  

  This project runs only on the adress of the central Flanders  
  zip File number 15 from Geopunt
